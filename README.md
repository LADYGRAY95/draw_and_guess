# ‚úèÔ∏è Draw & Guess AI

An AI-powered drawing recognition game built with **TensorFlow**, **Flask**, and a simple modern **web interface**.  
The model is trained on a subset of the Google QuickDraw dataset (10 categories).  

> Built as part of the CPU ISIMM, during the integration day of our institute ISIMM | Higher Institute of Computer Science and Mathematics of Monastir,

## üöÄ Features
- üñåÔ∏è Draw on a canvas and let the AI guess your doodle.  
- üéØ Supports **10 categories**: `apple, airplane, banana, cat, dog, car, chair, clock, house, tree`.  
- ‚ö° Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on QuickDraw data.  
- üåê Flask backend + HTML/CSS/JS frontend.  
- üìä Achieves good accuracy with a **small dataset**.
